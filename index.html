        <h1>Oh shucks, we are out of shirts!</h1>

        <p>It was a wild, wild ride, but sadly we're winding down. We are only one man (which is an odd thing to say) and simply do not have the time to keep printing these <em>amazing</em> shirts.</p>

        <p>Thank you to everyone who has purchased a shirt or has otherwise supported us over the last three years! For those of you still searching for a shirt, we thank you for stopping by, and wish you luck in your hunt!</p>

        <div class="orderForm">
        <p>I'VE BEEN TO DULUTH text on the front of a sand-colored t-shirt, with nothing on the back.</p>

        <p><strong>Shucks howdy! We are completely sold out of shirts, with no plans to restock. Sorry!</strong></p>

        </div>

        <p class="clear">Modeled after the very same shirt as seen in the movie <em>The Great Outdoors</em>, this t-shirt is bound to bring a smile to your face.  Who knows?  Empowered by the might of this awesome shirt, maybe you'll be inspired to start a resort of your own in the northern reaches of Wisconsin!  When you've been to Duluth, anything can happen.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, these shirts are...</p>

        <h3>Burly!</h3>

        <p><strong>All our shirts are made of 100% heavyweight ultra cotton.</strong>  We use name-brand Gildan&reg; t-shirts, which have been proven popular amongst resort towns and indie bands the world over.</p>
          
        <h3>Accurate!</h3>

        <p>We deployed our top typographers, who spent their time analyzing high-resolution screen grabs from <em>The Great Outdoors</em>, to ensure that <strong>you are getting the most accurate reprint possible.</strong></p>

        <p>That said, the shirt from the movie was quite filthy, and despite our quest for authenticity we chose not to go that route.  Your shirt is fine and clean, in a lovely tan color.  Once you've got one, you can make it as dirty as you want!</p>
          
        <h3>Duluthian!</h3>

        <p>That's right, all of our "I've Been To Duluth" t-shirts were <strong>proudly printed by a company located in Duluth, Minnesota.</strong></p>

        <h3>Awesomely Awesome!</h3>

        <p><strong>Did we mention these shirts are awesome?</strong>  They make great gifts for fans of Duluth, fans of <em>The Great Outdoors</em>, people who love being outside, and people who just plain get a kick out of wearing esoteric statements on their chests.</p>
