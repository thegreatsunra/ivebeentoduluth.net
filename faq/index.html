        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <a id="faq_shirts"></a>
        <h3>What kind of shirts are these?</h3>

        <p>These are high-quality, pre-shrunk, 100% heavyweight cotton t-shirts.  This ain't no Cafe Press nonsense.</p>

        <a id="faq_payment"></a>
        <h3>How do I pay?</h3>

        <p>All payments are made through <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>, using a major credit card.  You do not need a PayPal membership to place an order.</p>

        <a id="faq_shipping"></a>
        <h3>What about shipping?</h3>

        <p>We ship anywhere in the United States.  After placing your order, please allow one week for your shipment to arrive.  <strong>Currently we do not have the capacity, nor the guts, to ship internationally.</strong></p>

        <a id="faq_sizing"></a>
        <h3>Will my shirt fit?</h3>

        <p><a href="/sizing/">We have painstakingly measured every t-shirt to help you decide which size to buy.</a>  With the shirt laying completely flat, measurements were taken across the chest, and from the top of the shoulder to the bottom hem.  Measure your favorite t-shirt in this manner, and buy the I'VE BEEN TO DULUTH shirt that most closely matches those dimensions!</p>

        <a id="faq_exchange"></a>
        <h3>My shirt doesn't fit!  How do you handle returns and exchanges?</h3>

        <p>Please realize that all sales are final.  To avoid unnecessary pain and agony, we ask that you <a href="/sizing/">please refer to our sizing chart</a> to make sure the shirt you're buying will fit just the way you want it.</p>

        <p>That being said, if your unwashed shirt doesn't fit, we will gladly exchange it for one that does.  <a href="/contact/">Contact us</a> for more information regarding exchanges, or if you have any further questions.</p>

        <p>Please understand that washed t-shirts (or ones that are soaked in sweat, beer or maple syrup) cannot be exchanged.  </p>

        <a id="faq_gallery"></a>
        <h3>Hey, I got my shirt and I love it.  What next?</h3>

        <p>Hey, we're glad to hear that!  Send us pictures of you wearing your I'VE BEEN TO DULUTH shirt, and if we like it, we'll add you to our gallery!  Uhh, currently there is no gallery, seeing as how no one has these shirts.  Why don't you become the first, now, ya hear?</p>

        <a id="faq_print"></a>
        <h3>Who Prints These Shirts?</h3>

        <p>A real honest-to-god screenprinting company based in Duluth, Minnesota.</p>

        <a id="faq_audience"></a>
        <h3>Honestly, who would buy these shirts?</h3>

        <p>Anyone who has been to Duluth.  Also, anyone who hasn't been to Duluth, because that would be really funny.  People who have lived in Duluth, or people who currently live in Duluth, or people who spend their lives wishing, oh wishing so hard, that they lived in Duluth.  Relatives you love.  Relatives you hate.  Your twisted uncle who manages a resort in northern Wisconsin.</p>

        <a id="faq_dane"></a>
        <h3>Who Are You?</h3>

        <p>My name is Dane Petersen.  I spent four years living in Duluth and graduated from the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota Duluth</a>.  The biggest achievement of my life was when I was crowned vice-king geek at the first annual <a href="http://www.geekprom.com/">Geek Prom</a>, at the Norshor Theater in Duluth, Minnesota.</p>

        <p>I spend my summers guiding wilderness trips in northern Minnesota with area youth, and during the rest of the year I run a small web design company known as <a href="http://www.brainsideout.com/">Brainside Out</a>.  As chance would have it we have a website, along with one of those "weblog" things you hear so much about.</p>

        <a id="faq_movie"></a>
        <h3>What about the movie?</h3>

        <p>What <em>about</em> the movie?</p>

        <a id="faq_more"></a>
        <h3>I still have questions!  Lots of 'em!</h3>

        <p>If you have any further questions, <a href="/contact/">please feel free to contact us.</a>  Also, if you have any further answers to questions, such as the average airspeed of an unladen swallow, please contact us as well.  We love getting answers just as much as we love getting questions.</p>
